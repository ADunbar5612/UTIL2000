🔹 **Billing Structure**

The application applies a three-tier rate model:

Tier 1: First 500 kWh at $0.12 per kWh

Tier 2: Next 500 kWh (501–1000) at $0.15 per kWh

Tier 3: Any usage above 1000 kWh at $0.18 per kWh

Service Fee: Flat $14.95 per customer

This demonstrates conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and tier segmentation in COBOL.

🧠 **Concepts Demonstrated:**

This project applies several enterprise computing concepts:

Mainframe dataset and member management

COBOL program structure and modification

Working within ISPF editor

Job output monitoring using SDSF

Fixed-value data initialization

Multi-record processing logic
