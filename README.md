## Billing Structure

The application applies a three-tier rate model:

- **Tier 1:** First 500 kWh at $0.12 per kWh  
- **Tier 2:** Next 500 kWh (501–1000) at $0.15 per kWh  
- **Tier 3:** Any usage above 1000 kWh at $0.18 per kWh  
- **Service Fee:** Flat $14.95 per customer  

This demonstrates conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and tier segmentation in COBOL.
