# UTIL2000
📋 Project Overview

UTIL2000 is a COBOL utility billing program developed using an IBM mainframe environment through TN3270, working exclusively within ISPF and SDSF.

This assignment focuses on enterprise development workflows, including dataset management, COBOL program modification, mainframe tooling, and professional documentation practices.
:llama: Program Purpose

The goal of UTIL2000 is to calculate total utility costs for multiple customers by:

Processing predefined customer energy usage values

Applying a fixed service fee

Calculating and displaying total utility charges

The program expands the original single-customer logic to support multiple customer records.
:brain: Concepts Demonstrated:

This project applies several enterprise computing concepts:

Mainframe dataset and member management

COBOL program structure and modification

Working within ISPF editor

Job output monitoring using SDSF

Fixed-value data initialization

Multi-record processing logic

Professional documentation standards

GitHub version control workflow
