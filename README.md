# UTIL2000
📋 Project Overview

UTIL2000 is a COBOL utility billing program developed using an IBM mainframe environment through TN3270, working exclusively within ISPF and SDSF.

This assignment focuses on enterprise development workflows, including dataset management, COBOL program modification, mainframe tooling, and professional documentation practices.

🔹 Billing Structure

The application applies a three-tier rate model:

Tier 1: First 500 kWh at $0.12 per kWh

Tier 2: Next 500 kWh (501–1000) at $0.15 per kWh

Tier 3: Any usage above 1000 kWh at $0.18 per kWh

Service Fee: Flat $14.95 per customer

This demonstrates conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and tier segmentation in COBOL.

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated:

This project applies several enterprise computing concepts:

Mainframe dataset and member management

COBOL program structure and modification

Working within ISPF editor

Job output monitoring using SDSF

Fixed-value data initialization

Multi-record processing logic

Professional documentation standards

GitHub version control workflow
